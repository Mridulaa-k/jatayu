# JATAYU â€“ Journey Assistive Technology for Active Yielding and Urgency

**JATAYU** is an intelligent safety system designed to monitor the driverâ€™s health and ensure a safer journey. This embedded system detects emergency conditions such as drowsiness, fatigue, and heart abnormalities, and takes action to reduce the chances of accidents by controlling the vehicle and sending alerts.

---

## ðŸš— Objective

To develop a real-time driver assistance system that:
- Monitors vital health parameters
- Detects signs of drowsiness and fatigue
- Takes preventive actions like slowing down the vehicle
- Sends emergency messages with live GPS location

---

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features

- **Heartbeat Monitoring**  
  Uses a pulse sensor to track the driver's heart rate and detect abnormalities like tachycardia or bradycardia.

- **Sleep Detection**  
  Employs an infrared sensor or camera to observe eye movement and head posture to detect drowsiness or inattention.

- **Automatic Speed Control**  
  If critical conditions are detected, the system slows down the vehicle safely and pulls it to the side.

- **Emergency Communication**  
  With GSM and GPS modules, JATAYU sends an SOS message including the vehicleâ€™s current location to emergency contacts or services.

- **Trigger Threshold Alert**  
  Uses actuators to apply targeted stimuli (like vibration) to alert the driver during critical conditions.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- **Microcontroller**: ESP32 / Arduino
- **Modules**: Pulse Sensor, GSM Module, GPS Module, Camera/IR Sensor
- **Motor Driver**: L298N or similar for controlling vehicle movement
- **Programming**: Embedded C / Arduino IDE
